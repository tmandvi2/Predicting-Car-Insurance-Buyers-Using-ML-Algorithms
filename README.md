Predicting potential car insurance buyers in a pool of already medical insurance customers using ML algorithms


The project provides an in-depth overview of a cross-selling initiative undertaken by a **large international insurance company**. Below is a detailed summary of the key points:

---

#### **Industry Context**
The insurance industry is inherently competitive, offering a diverse portfolio of products. One of its key challenges is **retaining existing customers** while encouraging them to purchase additional policies. This strategic focus on **cross-selling** is vital for revenue growth and customer loyalty.

#### **Dataset Overview**
The study is based on a dataset provided by the company, capturing an attempt to cross-sell **car insurance** to existing medical insurance policyholders. The dataset includes:
1. **Training Set (`bzan6357_insurance_3_TRAINING.csv`):**
   - Contains historical data to build predictive models.
   - Likely includes customer demographics, interactions, and past purchasing behavior.

2. **Score Set (`bzan6357_insurance_3_SCORE.csv`):**
   - Used for evaluating and scoring predictive models on unseen data.
   - Represents a real-world application of the insights derived.

The data offers valuable insights into **customer behavior** and interaction patterns that influence their decision to purchase additional policies.
